		<p>My first blog from Montana code school week one.  This first week has been a blur or learning and coding.  The class is great a bunch of people and we are all about at about the same level.  Week one has been a good intro into javascript and html and css.  We started with making static pages what could display a 3 by 3 grid, we then started to add elements to that 3 by 3 bored.  We added a hero that could cross the bored with a goal in mind that when the hero reaches a certain spot the game would be over or the hero would die.  This meant we needed a reset button for when the player died and also something to happen when the player reached his or her goal.  Next we wanted to make our grid bigger without hardcoding to do this we used a javascript for loop that could generate a grid to any size we specified and only a few lines of code.  Where as before our grid had a line of html for every cell on the grid.  Week one we also did a lot a fun team building activities that I think really brought the whole class together and I feel fortunate be part of such a good group of people.  All that is left now is some serious coding.</p>
